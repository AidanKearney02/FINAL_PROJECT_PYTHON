#### What have you done for your project so far?

Up to this point in the project I have been doing a lot of ready. I am dealing with some stuff I’m not too familiar with which has been a little difficult. I wasn’t able to get ffmpeg into my environment variables, which is needed in order to make a music bot. Thankfully earlier today I was able to figure it out and now have started to do some more prepping for when I start to code. I’ve been importing everything I need and plan on coding tomorrow.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I haven’t started almost any of my actual coding such as all my if, and elif statements


#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Like I stated above my biggest problem so far was understanding what ffmpeg is, does, and how to get it into my environment variables
