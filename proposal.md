# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Music Bot

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A bot you add to your discrod that lates you play any song with just a few commands 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

What I am trying to accomplish in this project is to create a music bot for Discord that allows you to listen to any song you want to with a simple command by using FFmpeg. This is a software that formats any video and music link put into it. This is necessary due to Discord needing this software for the bot to work. How the bot will work is you type in a command such as ?play *then songs name* after doing that, the bot will find the song you typed in or link provided using FFmpeg and then start playing. I would also like to add a pause and resume feature and possibly a skip feature as well but it depends on how smooth the project goes and the time I have.


## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

I am not planning on doing that but maybe later into my college career.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

I am not planning on working with anyone.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will get the music bot running and working no matter what with hopes to add a skip, pause, and resume feature. If I run out of time I will not be adding the last three features listed.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I thibk I can accomplish everything listed above but this all depends on time.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

finishing the bot and all the features I want to add to it.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

For starters, I have never coded something for Discord so the first steps and steps I have been taking are learning how to and reading about how Discord takes code, what commands you need in your code to be usable in Discord and lastly learning about FFmpeg. After this read about how to put all these together such as downloading and paring FFmpeg with Discord and my code, and then start the coding process if I get stuck read and research the part on which Iâ€™m stuck.
